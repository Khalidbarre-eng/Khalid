        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in Mogadishu, Somalia, I am a seasoned economist and Results-Based Financing (RBF) specialist with a decade of experience. As a Public Financial Management (PFM) practitioner, I have honed my expertise in government financial management systems (FMS/FGS) and partnership development. My recent seven years in FGS and FMS Finance Ministries were dedicated to advancing domestic resource mobilization, crafting budget policies, and streamlining public financial management for social sectors, notably health service management.</p>
        <p>I am a PhD candidate in Economics and hold a Masterâ€™s degree in International Banking and Finance, a CIFP in Islamic Economics and Finance, and a BSc in Economics. My broad experience encompasses project development in health, environmental economics, and public finance, with a particular focus on monitoring, evaluation, and data management in Somalia.</p>
        <p>Skilled in collaborating with diverse governmental and private entities, I excel in project identification and implementation that elevate community standards. My background includes successful stakeholder engagement, robust reporting, team leadership, and developing effective management systems. My competencies include institutional enhancement, result-oriented management, comprehensive knowledge of public financial management, and proficiency in health financing and disaster response.</p>
        <p>Committed to leadership that fosters organizational excellence, I am fluent in Somali, English, Arabic, and Turkish, ready to drive impactful change across multilingual platforms.</p>
